# Dependency Fix: React Three Fiber Compatibility

## Problem

The build failed with an npm ERESOLVE error due to a version conflict:
- `@react-three/fiber` v9.0.0 (required for React 19)
- `@react-three/drei` v9.91.0 (requires R3F v8, not v9)

## Root Cause

**Version Compatibility Matrix:**
- React 18 → `@react-three/fiber` v8.x → `@react-three/drei` v9.x
- React 19 → `@react-three/fiber` v9.x → `@react-three/drei` v10.x

Since WalleOS uses React 19 and Next.js 15, we need Drei v10.x (not v9.x).

## Solution

### Step 1: Update package.json

Change the `@react-three/drei` version from `^9.91.0` to `^10.0.0`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@react-three/drei": "^10.0.0",
  "@react-three/fiber": "^9.0.0"
}
```

### Step 2: Clean install

```bash
# Remove old dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Fresh install
npm install
```

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
# Check installed versions
npm list @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei

# Should show:
# @react-three/fiber@9.x.x
# @react-three/drei@10.x.x
```

### Step 4: Test

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Alternative: Remove WebGL (Optional)

If you want to avoid the Three.js complexity entirely, you can remove the WebGL background:

### Remove dependencies:
```bash
npm uninstall @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei three @types/three
```

### Remove files:
- Delete `components/WebGLBackground.tsx`
- Remove `<WebGLBackground />` from `app/page.tsx`

The terminal aesthetic works great without WebGL!

## Why This Happened

The initial implementation plan used `@react-three/drei` v9.x, which was correct for React 18 but not React 19. The Drei team released v10.x in 2025 specifically for React 19 support, which is a breaking change.

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get errors:

```bash
# Force clean install
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### If you want to use legacy resolution:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Note:** Using `--legacy-peer-deps` is not recommended as it bypasses peer dependency checks. The proper fix is to update to compatible versions.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed by upgrading `@react-three/drei` to v10.x
