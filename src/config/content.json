    "latest-project": "My latest build is Neon Atlas, a collaborative AI storyboard tool for boutique studios. I led the product vision, shaped the sonic brand, and prototyped a gesture-heavy interface that keeps teams in flow. The best part is watching clients remix prompts live and still stay aligned.",

Trading static decks for living prototypes let me blend research instincts with a love for expressive interfaces. Now I still obsess over human moments, but I ship them with code.",
    "design-process": "Every project starts with listening tours and scrapbooks of inspiration from outside the obvious category. I prototype embarrassingly early, then invite stakeholders into weekly remix sessions so we co-own the risks. The loop ends with motion studies and a narrative that explains not just what we built, but how it feels.",

    "experience-skills": "That chapter sharpened my {skills}, especially while leading initiatives like {achievement}. It was a playground for blending craft with leadership and learning where to stretch next.",
    "experience-challenges": "The biggest challenge at {company} was {challenge}. I navigated it by leaning on {skills} and close collaboration with stakeholders, which turned the obstacle into a launchpad for a stronger roadmap.",
    "experience-impact": "Impact looked like measurable shifts‚Äîduring that period we {impact}. It was the result of pairing {skills} with deliberate experimentation across the team.",
    "experience-transition": "Leaving {company} was about following the thread of growth. After building {achievement} and scaling {skills}, I was ready to tackle problems where I could apply that momentum in new domains.",
    "experience-default": "That role at {company} as {title} ran from {period}. It was a pivotal season where I balanced {skills} with hands-on experimentation to keep the team shipping meaningful work.",
    "default": "That's a fun angle. Let me riff for a moment and share how I'm approaching that in my current experiments‚Äîfeel free to push back or steer me elsewhere."
