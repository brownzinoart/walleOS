    "latest-project": "My latest build is Neon Atlas, a collaborative AI storyboard tool for boutique studios. I led the product vision, shaped the sonic brand, and prototyped a gesture-heavy interface that keeps teams in flow. The best part is watching clients remix prompts live and still stay aligned.",
    "career-shift": "I moved from UX into hybrid design-engineering because shipping ideas is the fastest way to learn. Trading static decks for living prototypes let me blend research instincts with a love for expressive interfaces. Now I still obsess over human moments, but I ship them with code.",
    "design-process": "Every project starts with listening tours and scrapbooks of inspiration from outside the obvious category. I prototype embarrassingly early, then invite stakeholders into weekly remix sessions so we co-own the risks. The loop ends with motion studies and a narrative that explains not just what we built, but how it feels.",
    "current-work": "Right now I'm exploring adaptive onboarding flows for a privacy-first fintech startup. I'm threading Gen Z pop energy into a serious product without losing trust signals. It means lots of accessibility testing, microcopy jams, and wild gradients restrained just enough.",
    "default": "That's a fun angle. Let me riff for a moment and share how I'm approaching that in my current experiments‚Äîfeel free to push back or steer me elsewhere."
